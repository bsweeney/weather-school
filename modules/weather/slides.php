	<div class="scrollable">
	<p style="margin-left: 15px;">You have now examined how air temperature in a particular place can vary considerably from one day to the next. This variation is caused by the movement of large masses of warm and cool air.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 15px;">As the wind blows, warmer or cooler air is constantly moving into and out of an area, and this movement of air changes the temperature at that place.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 15px;">To see how clouds and, therefore, air move across the United States, click on the following web links. The cloud movement has been speeded up, but you can see from these videos that the air above us is always moving. Sometimes this means that warmer air is moving in from another location and sometimes colder air is moving into a place. This never ending process goes on continuously around the world.</p>

			<div>
				<p>First choose a location on the map by clicking on that location.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Now use the calendar to choose a year.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>What you see here is a graph of the average daily temperatures that were reported at [the selected location] for [the selected year].</p>
				<p>Temperature can be read on the y-axis (the vertical axis), and time of year can be read on the x-axis (the horizontal axis).</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The temperature that you see reported for a given day is the average of the temperature measurements that were taken at that reporting station for that day. Some stations collect air temperature data every hour, and some collect air temperature data less often.  But however many measurements that were taken, the number you see is the <span class="tooltip" title="average is a mean of the measurements and that the mean is calculated by adding together all the measurements and dividing by the number of measurements.">average</span> of them for that date. You may see that there are some days when there were no data reported at that station, perhaps  because there was no one to record it or because the measuring equipment was not working.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Notice that the temperature rises and falls throughout the year.  You should also notice that the temperature goes up and down from day to day in a jagged way.  The curve is not perfectly smooth.  This is because even though there is an overall trend in how the temperature increases or decreases throughout the year, there is also variation in that pattern of increasing and decreasing from day to day.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Next let's look more closely at this day-to-day variation.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>As you can see above, the first part of the graph has been highlighted. This allows you to zoom in and look at a smaller part of the curve more closely.</p>
				<p>When you want to zoom in, all you have to do is place your cursor at one corner of the rectangle that you want to look at, click and hold at that spot, and drag the cursor to cover the area you want to highlight. If you make a mistake, you can just click on “reset zoom” and try again.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Now let's view the graph after we've zoomed in.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>In the image above, just the temperatures for days in January are included. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>By hovering over a date, you can see the average temperature reported for that day.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You can also see how much change there is in the average temperature from day to day. Notice that in this example, on January 20, 2000, the average temperature for that day was 25.5o F.  But the day before, on January 19, the average temperature was 41.7 o F. That’s a big change in one day. The only thing that could cause that much change is cold air moving in from another location.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Now you try it. Highlight just the month of January as shown on the previous page.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Move the cursor to see what the temperature is on the individual days.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Highlight other parts of the graph to observe day-to-day patterns.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Choose different locations and different times of the year to see how the temperature changes at those locations during the year.</p>

			<div>
				<p>What do you notice? You should see that the temperature rises and falls throughout each year. For example, it’s coldest in January and warmest in July.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>But is it identical from year to year? No, even though the pattern is very similar from one year to the next, there is also variation from year to year.  For example, the highest temperature in July 2002 is higher than the highest temperature in either July of 2000 or July of 2001.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>Variation may be due to the reliability of the measuring instrument, or it could be due to colder or warmer air moving in from another location.

	<h2>Temperature and Large Bodies of Water</h2>
	<p>In the previous activities, you saw that the air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is from the tropical zone (its latitude) and that air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is above sea level (its elevation). The higher the latitude (farther from the tropical zone), the colder the place is, and the higher the elevation of a place, the colder the place is. This assumes, of course, that all other factors are kept constant. Obviously a place in the Rocky Mountains in the summer could be warmer than a place in New York City in the winter.</p>
	<p>In this activity, you are going to try to find out whether or not how close a place is to a large body of water affects the air temperature at that place.</p>

				<p>In this activity, you are going to see what effect being close to a large body of water has on air temperature at a place.</p>

				<p>The map above pinpoints Troms, Norway, which is located on the Norwegian Sea. In this activity you will explore the temperature patterns in Troms and a town 125 miles southest of Troms, Kautokeino. Both locations are highlighted on the map.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The graph above shows the average daily temperatures in Troms and in Kautokeino from December 31, 2003 to Dec. 30, 2004.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>What you should see is that at some times of the year the place that is closer to the water is cooler than the place that is farther from the water, but at other times of the year it is just the opposite. Then it's colder farther away from the water.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You should also notice that the line on the graph for the place that is closer to the water is flatter than the line for the place that is farther from the water. There is a bigger range between high and low temperatures during the year in the place that is farther from the water. The high temperature for the year is higher and the low temperature is lower when you are farther from a large body of water.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The reason for these patterns is that the temperature of the water has an effect on the air around it. As long as the water isn't frozen, the water makes the air above it warmer than it would otherwise be in the winter, and it makes the air above it cooler than it would otherwise be in the summer. Being closer to water also makes the difference between high and low temperatures smaller than if you were farther from the water.</p>

	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<div class="scrollable">
	<p>You have now examined three factors that are related to the air temperature at a particular location: (1) how close a place is to the equator (latitude), (2) how far a place is above sea level (elevation), and (3) how close a place is to a large body of water.</p>
	<p>There is one other factor that has been mentioned, but it was not demonstrated in this module. That is whether or not a mass of cold or warm air has moved into a place to affect its temperature. You should know that as the wind blows, warmer or cooler air is constantly moving into and out of an area, which changes the temperature of the air at that place.</p>
	<p>To see how clouds and, therefore, air move across the United States, click on the following web links. The speed of cloud movement has been speeded up, but you can see from these videos that the air above us is always moving. Sometimes this means that warmer air is moving in from another location and sometimes colder air is moving into a region.</p>

			<div>Notice  first that the hours of daylight changes throughout the year at this location.  On the first day of fall there are about 12 hours of daylight, in late June  there are about 15 hours of daylight, and in late December there are just over  9 hours of daylight.</div>

			<div>Remember that we are talking about hours of &ldquo;daylight,&rdquo; not hours of  &ldquo;sunlight.&rdquo; Because some days are rainy or cloudy and others are clear, there  are big changes in the number of hours of sunlight each day, but the time the sun rises and sets changes very gradually from day to day.</div>
			<div>Remember that when you looked at the graph for air temperature, there was variation not only from day to day but also from year to year. Is that also true for the number of hours of daylight? What can you say about the change in hours of daylight at a place on a particular date (for example, October 1st) from one year to the next?</div>
			<div>What you should see is that the number of hours of daylight does not change from year to year. There are the same number of hours of daylight on October 1st, no matter what year it is.</div>

	<h2>Hours of Daylight and Air Temperature</h2>
	<p>In the last module you saw that the hours of daylight at a location changes over the course of the year in a way that is very similar to the pattern for changes in air temperature and maximum height of the Sun in the sky. You have also seen that there is a relationship between the maximum height of the Sun in the sky and air temperature. The higher the Sun in the sky, the warmer it tends to be.</p>
	<p>In this module you will look at the relationship between hours of daylight and air temperature at a given place. You will see if hours of daylight at a place is related to air temperature at that place.</p>

	<h2>Additional Data Tools</h2>
	<p>In the previous activities, you saw that the air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is from the tropical zone (its latitude) and that air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is above sea level (its elevation). The higher the latitude (farther from the tropical zone), the colder the place is, and the higher the elevation of a place, the colder the place is. This assumes, of course, that all other factors are kept constant. Obviously a place in the Rocky Mountains in the summer could be warmer than a place in New York City in the winter.</p>
	<p>In this activity, you are going to try to find out whether or not how close a place is to a large body of water affects the air temperature at that place.</p>

You were  also able to compare those changes at different places.

	<div class="scrollable">
	<ul>
		<li>First let&rsquo;s review some basic ideas about how  the earth and sun are related.</li>
		<li>A good way to start is by trying to make sense  of the model above.</li>
		<li>The first thing to remember is that the earth  moves around the sun. It makes one full trip around the sun in a year. It gets  a quarter of the way around in three months and half way around in six months.</li>
		<li>Another thing to keep in mind is that it stays  in the same plane as it moves around the sun, as if it were rolling along a  flat surface. It doesn&rsquo;t bounce up and down as it goes around the sun. </li>
		<li>When you look at the diagram, you can also see that  the axis of the earth (the line between the North and South Poles) is always  tilted. That tilt does not change throughout the year. This means that the  North Pole is always aimed toward the same point in space no matter where the  earth is in its path around the sun.</li>
		<li>The tilt of earth&rsquo;s axis is always 23.5o  away from the straight up and down line that you see in the diagram. If you  think of the plane of the earth&rsquo;s orbit as a table top, the straight up and  down line would be coming straight up from the top of the table. In other  words, that line would be perpendicular to the table top.</li>
		<li>The correct mathematical way to describe the  tilt of the earth is to say: The earth&rsquo;s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5o  from a line that is perpendicular to the plane of the earth&rsquo;s orbit around the  sun. Look carefully at the diagram to see if this statement makes sense to you.  First look at the plane of earth&rsquo;s orbit represented in the diagram as a dark  gray flat surface that the earth moves around the sun on. Then find the line  that is drawn perpendicular to that plane. Finally, note the way the earth is  tilted relative to that perpendicular line.</li>

		<li>One more thing to keep in mind is that the earth spins  on its axis once every 24 hours.  This is  the day night cycle. </li>
		<li>In the diagram above, imagine that the sun is far to  the right. The part of the earth that is facing the sun is in daylight, and the  part of the earth that is facing away from the sun is in darkness.</li>
		<li>As the earth spins on its axis, different places move  into and out of daylight.</li>
		<li>The sun rises in the east, gets higher and higher in  the sky until it reaches its maximum height in the middle of the day, then  starts to get lower and lower in the sky until it finally sets in the west late  in the day.</li>
		<li>As the sun gets higher in the sky, the amount of  energy that a place on earth gets from the sun increases, and the temperature  rises. As the sun gets lower in the sky, the amount of energy at that place  decreases, and the  temperature drops. </li>

		<li>Finally,  to complete the story of the geometry of the earth-sun system, we need to pay  attention to the fact that the earth is a sphere. </li>
		<li>Because  the earth is a sphere, the light from the sun strikes the earth at different  angles at different places.</li>
		<li>Look  at the spheres below. Notice that when you shine a light on a sphere, the part  of the sphere that is closest to the light source is illuminated most brightly.  This is the place where the light strikes the sphere at a 90 degree angle.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Notice  that there is only one place on the surface of the sphere where the sun strikes  the sphere at a 90 degree angle. At all other places, the light strikes at less  than a 90 degree angle. The farther away from the place where the light strikes  at a 90 degree angle, the smaller the angle of the light is. </li>
		<li>This  is also true on the surface of the earth. At any one time, there is only one  place where the sun strikes the earth at a 90 degree angle. The farther away  from that place a location is, the smaller the angle at which the sun strikes  the earth. At the North Pole, for example, the sun always strikes the earth at  a very low angle, and at some times of the year the sun is not visible at all.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>As you can see, earth-sun system is very complicated.  The earth is spinning at the same time it is orbiting around the earth, and  because the earth&rsquo;s axis is tilted, we see  the sun differently at different times of the year.</li>
		<li>To keep things simple, when we model this complex  system, we will not always show all the parts moving at the same time. This  will allow us to focus on one thing at a time.</li>
		<li>In the next set of activities, you will start out by  looking at a dynamic (moving) model of the earth-sun system with the parts in  motion, and then you will look at a number of static images of the same  system.  Altogether this should give you  a better understanding of the changes that take place throughout the year.</li>

			<div><p>If  the sun isn&rsquo;t directly overhead at the equator, where <em>is</em> it directly overhead?</p></div>

			<div><p>Because  the North Pole is tilted 23.5 degrees toward the sun on the first day of  summer, 23.5o N latitude is the place where the sun strikes at a 90  degree angle.

			<div><p>Where  is 23.5o N latitude? There is actually no place in the U.S. that is  at 23.5o N latitude.  23.5o  N latitude is just a little bit south of Key West, Florida, the southernmost place  in the country, and just a little bit north of Havana, Cuba.</p></div>

You can follow 23.5o  N latitude around the world starting just south of Florida in the U.S., then eastward  through northern Africa, northern India, southern China, and finally across the  Pacific Ocean and through Mexico before you end up back where you started.</p></div>
			<div><p>As  the earth rotates on its axis, creating the day night cycle, the maximum height  the sun will reach on June 22 at places that are 23.5o N latitude is  90 degrees. The sun will be directly overhead in the middle of the day at that  latitude, but nowhere else.</p></div>

			<div><p>To  keep track of what you are doing, vary just one thing at a time.  For example, keep the person&rsquo;s location  constant and vary the time of year. Then keep the time of year constant and  vary the location. In each case, you will be looking for patterns in how  location and time of year affect the angle of the sun&rsquo;s rays.</p></div>
