# Weather-School

This repository contains an old version of the source for (weatherschool.aaas.org)[http://weatherschool.aaas.org/], a project for which I managed curriculum development and did front-end design in the final year of the grant.

This is an educational resource to teach middle-school students about weather patterns by the team at AAAS's [Project2061](http://project2061.aaas.org).
